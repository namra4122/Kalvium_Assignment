# KALVIUM ASSIGNMENT

## Task:

Implement a co-viewer for PDF slides. As a user, if 5 users goto a page - their current PDF page is synchronized. If the admin user moves the slide, it changes for all the viewers.

Usecase: Imagine that a presenter will use this remotely with N viewers. Or a teacher is going to open a PDF link, and all the students are going to follow along.
